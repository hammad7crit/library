Data (JavaScript side)

Make a Book constructor.

Store all books in an array (myLibrary).

Write a function (addBookToLibrary) that creates a book (with a unique id) and pushes it into the array.

Display (UI side)

Write a function that loops through myLibrary and shows each book on the page (as cards or in a table).

Keep data logic (array) separate from display logic (DOM).

Form to Add Books

Add a “New Book” button.

Clicking it shows a form (modal, sidebar, or inline) where user enters book details (title, author, pages, read status).

Use event.preventDefault() so the form doesn’t refresh the page.

When submitted, create the book and add it to the library.

Book Actions

Each displayed book has:

A Remove button → deletes it from the library.

A Toggle Read button → flips its read status using a prototype method.

👉 In short: Build a small library app where books live in an array, show up on the page, can be added with a form, removed, and toggled between read/unread.
